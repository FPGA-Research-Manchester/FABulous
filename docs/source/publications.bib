	abstract = {At the end of CMOS-scaling, the role of architecture design is increasingly gaining importance. Supporting this trend, customizable embedded FPGAs are an ingredient in ASIC architectures to provide the advantages of reconfigurable hardware exactly where and how it is most beneficial. To enable this, we are introducing the FABulous embedded open-source FPGA framework. FABulous is designed to fulfill the objectives of ease of use, maximum portability to different process nodes, good control for customization, and delivering good area, power, and performance characteristics of the generated FPGA fabrics. The framework provides templates for logic, arithmetic, memory, and I/O blocks that can be easily stitched together, whilst enabling users to add their own fully customized blocks and primitives. The FABulous ecosystem generates the embedded FPGA fabric for chip fabrication, integrates Yosys, ABC, VPR and nextpnr as FPGA CAD tools, deals with the bitstream generation and after fabrication tests. Additionally, we provide an emulation path for system development. FABulous was demonstrated for an ASIC integrating a RISC-V core with an embedded FPGA fabric for custom instruction set extensions using a TSMC 180nm process and an open-source 45nm process node.},
