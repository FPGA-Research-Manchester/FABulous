# Timing Characterization

FABulous can produce a timing model that maps physical or structural design information
into pip delays used by nextpnr (the `pips.txt` format). The timing model is generated
from gate-level netlists and (optionally) parasitic RC data (SPEF) and Liberty timing
libraries. Two main modes are supported:

- `physical`: Uses a post-layout (routed) netlist and parasitic information (SPEF)
    to produce more realistic delay estimates.
- `structural`: Uses the structural (gate-level) netlist without parasitics, useful
    when no post-layout data is available.

Internally the flow performs synthesis (or uses provided netlists), runs static
timing analysis (STA) with a backend such as OpenSTA, parses the produced SDF
timing information into a timing graph, computes delays for fabric pips, and
writes an output pip file that nextpnr can consume.

This page explains how the pieces fit together, how to generate and use a
configuration template, and how to run the timing-model generation from the
FABulous CLI or programmatically.

## How it works (high level)

1. Prepare inputs: gate-level netlists, Liberty (.lib) files and (for physical mode)
     SPEF/RC files. These can either be the project defaults or provided per-tile.
2. Create or modify a timing model configuration (JSON) which lists the paths to
     the required files and tools, and selects the mode and analysis options.
3. Run the FABulous timing-model flow (CLI command `timing_model`) with the
     configuration file or let FABulous resolve defaults from a supported PDK.
4. FABulous will (depending on the config): run synthesis (Yosys) if needed,
     run STA (OpenSTA) to create an SDF timing file, parse the SDF into a timing graph,
     compute pip delays per tile, and write the `pips.txt` file for nextpnr.
5. The fully-resolved configuration used for the run is written to
     `.FABulous/timing_model_config_resolved.json` so you can inspect what FABulous
     actually used.

## Running the timing model from the CLI

The FABulous interactive CLI exposes the command `timing_model`. Key options:

- `--mode [physical|structural]` — Select analysis mode. Default: `physical`.
- `--outdir <path>` — Directory the timed place-and-route model is written to
    (default: `.FABulous/`).
- `--backend <tool>` — Place-and-route backend to model. Defaults to the
    project's `pnr_backend` setting.
- `--emit-config-template` — Emit a JSON configuration template and exit.
- `--outfile <path>` — Where that template is written. Passing it without
    `--emit-config-template` is an error, not a silently ignored option.
- `--with-config-file <path>` — Use the supplied JSON config instead of PDK defaults.

:::{note}
The timed model replaces the untimed one in `.FABulous/`, which is where nextpnr
reads it from. Point `--outdir` elsewhere to keep the untimed model in place;
`gen_pnr_model` regenerates it either way.
:::

### Examples

In the default setting the timing model does not need a custom configuration, instead it
expects default paths and PDK setting, that means the backend flow must be run
first with a supported PDK by FABulous.

A simple working flow will look like:

```bash
FABulous create-project demo_test
FABulous -p demo_test run "run_fab"
```

At this point all rtl files for the tiles were
generated and we have enough information to run
the timing model in `structural` mode. This mode
approximates the delay based on the rtl code without
the need of any physical data - no backend flow required.
But the results are likely less accurate compared to a run
that uses physical information.

We continue with:

```bash
FABulous -p demo_test run "timing_model --mode structural"
```

After that the timing model has been generated and
the results were generated in `demo_test/.FABulous/pip.txt`
and `demo_test/.FABulous/timing_model_config_resolved.json`

In order to obtain more accurate timing information that actually represents
the design the FABulous GDS-FLOW must be run before the timing model,
that means in our example:

```bash
gen_all_tile_macros
# or
gen_fabric_macro
```

Then we can run:

```bash
FABulous -p demo_test run "timing_model
```

The output files are the same as with the `structural`
mode but the delay estimates will now represent the
the physical design.


## Configuration JSON: fields and meaning

The timing-model configuration is validated using the `TimingModelConfig`
Pydantic model. The important fields are documented below, paths are interpreted
relative to `project_dir` unless absolute.

- `project_dir` — Base directory for resolving relative paths.
Usually your project root.
- `liberty_files` — One or more Liberty (.lib) files providing cell timing information.
REQUIRED. Define here the timing library for the desired corner.
- `min_buf_cell_and_ports`  — Example: "cell_name in_port out_port".
Used to identify the buffer cell to map minimal buffer insertion.
- `synth_executable`  — Path to Yosys (or other synth tool) if synthesis is required.
- `sta_executable` — Path to the STA tool (e.g. OpenSTA) required to generate SDF from the netlist.
- `techmap_files` — Optional techmap/verilog files used by the synthesiser to produce gate-level
netlists for the target cell library. Sometimes needed to map multiplexers and latch gates.
- `pdk_name` — Optional PDK identifier. if FABulous knows defaults for that PDK
it can use automatic values (like liberty_files and techmap_files).
- `custom_per_tile_source_files` — Optional mapping from tile name to per-tile overrides.
Each value is an object with:
    - `rtl_files` — RTL sources for that tile.
    - `netlist_file` — A pre-generated netlist (gate-level or routed for the tile.
    if set it will be used instead of the project default netlist.
    - `rc_file` — SPEF/RC file for that tile (used in physical mode).
- `sta_program` / `synth_program` — Strings naming the backends (e.g. opensta, yosys).
- `mode` — physical or structural.
- `consider_wire_delay` — Boolean. Include wire delay when computing pip delays.
- `delay_type_str` — Which DelayType to use (max_all, min_all, avg_all, etc.).
- `delay_scaling_factor` — Multiplier applied to computed delays (numeric). Mostly useful
when the timing model was run with structural mode to compensate the more optimistic approximation.
- `debug` — Enable verbose logging to help debugging.

### Example configuration (shortened)

```json
{
    "project_dir": "/path/to/demo_test",
    "liberty_files": "libs/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib",
    "min_buf_cell_and_ports": "sky130_fd_sc_hd__buf_1 A X",
    "synth_executable": "/usr/bin/yosys",
    "sta_executable": "/usr/bin/sta",
    "techmap_files": [
        "tools/latch_map.v",
        "tools/tribuff_map.v"
    ],
    "custom_per_tile_source_files": {
        "RAM_IO": {
            "rtl_files": [
                "demo_test/Tile/RAM_IO/*.v",
                "demo_test/Fabric/models_pack.v"
            ],
            "netlist_file": "demo_test/Tile/RAM_IO/phys/RAM_IO.v",
            "rc_file": "demo_test/Tile/RAM_IO/phys/RAM_IO.spef"
        }
    },
    "sta_program": "opensta",
    "synth_program": "yosys",
    "mode": "physical",
    "consider_wire_delay": true,
    "delay_type_str": "max_all",
    "delay_scaling_factor": 1.0,
    "debug": false
}
```

Notes about the example:

- `custom_per_tile_source_files` is optional. Use it if you have tile-specific
    post-layout netlists / SPEFs or custom RTL for a tile. The keys should match
    your tile type names.
- Paths may be absolute or relative to `project_dir`.

## Using templates and per-tile overrides

1. Generate a template with `--emit-config-template` and open the resulting JSON.
2. Fill in the required fields shown above. Paths are easier to manage if you use
     paths relative to `project_dir`.
3. If only some tiles have post-layout netlists / SPEF, add entries under
     `custom_per_tile_source_files` to point to those files, other tiles will use
     the project's defaults.

## Outputs

- `pips.txt` in `--outdir` (default `.FABulous/`) — the nextpnr pip delay file.
    The backend decides the full artifact set; for nextpnr the other five files
    are the same ones `gen_pnr_model` emits.
- `.FABulous/timing_model_config_resolved.json` — The resolved, validated
    configuration that was used for the run. Inspect this file to see absolute
    paths and the effective settings.

## Debugging and common issues

- Missing or incorrect paths: Pydantic validation will raise errors when required
    fields are missing. Ensure `liberty_files`, `synth_executable` and
    `sta_executable` are present and correct.
- Tools not found or failing: Make sure `yosys` and `opensta` are available and
    executable in the environment, or set full paths in the config.
- In physical mode you must provide SPEF/RC files (per-tile or project-wide) if
    you want wire/parasitic delays to be included.
- If runs fail silently, enable `debug: true` in the config and re-run — the
    flow will produce more detailed log messages.

## Programmatic usage

If you prefer not to use the CLI, the same functionality is exposed by the
FABulous API. Example (python):

```py
from pathlib import Path

from fabulous.fabric_cad.timing_model.models import TimingModelConfig
from fabulous.fabric_definition.define import HDLType
from fabulous.fabulous_api import FABulous_API
from fabulous.fabulous_repl.helper import write_pnr_model
from fabulous.plugins.manager import PluginManager

# The manager owns discovery, and builds the writer the API generates through.
manager = PluginManager.create()
writer = manager.make_writer(HDLType.VERILOG)
fab_api = FABulous_API(writer, plugin_manager=manager)
fab_api.loadFabric(Path('fabric.csv'))

# load or construct a TimingModelConfig (validate with Pydantic)
config = TimingModelConfig.model_validate_json(Path('my_config.json').read_text())
resolved, artifacts = fab_api.timing_model_interface(
    mode='physical',
    debug=True,
    manual_config=config,
)

# The interface returns the artifact set; the caller decides where it lands.
write_pnr_model(artifacts, Path('.FABulous'))
```
