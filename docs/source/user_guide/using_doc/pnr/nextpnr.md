# Nextpnr models

After the FABulous flow has run successfully, the model files that describe your fabric
to nextpnr can be found in the project directory under `.FABulous`.
nextpnr reads them at start-up through the `fabulous` viaduct micro-architecture
(`generic/viaduct/fabulous/fabulous.cc` in the nextpnr tree).
The environment variable `FAB_ROOT` must point at the project directory so
nextpnr can find all model files.

## Generated model files

| File               | Purpose                                                                              |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `bel.txt`          | Legacy (1.0) BEL list, one line per BEL. No longer read by nextpnr                    |
| `bel.v2.txt`       | Block-structured BEL description used by current (2.0) projects                       |
| `bel.v3.txt`       | `bel.v2.txt` plus per-BEL timing arcs (see [](#belv3txt-bel-timing))                  |
| `pips.txt`         | Routing resources (programmable interconnect points) and their delays                |
| `placement_estimate.txt`  | The fabric's base delay scaling factors (see [](#placement-estimate))                     |
| `template.pcf`     | A pin-constraint template listing the fabric's IO BELs                                |

nextpnr selects the BEL file as follows:

- if `.FABulous/bel.v3.txt` exists, it is used and the design is timing-aware for
  BELs as well as pips;
- otherwise `.FABulous/bel.v2.txt` is used (BEL timing falls back to built-in
  defaults baked into the viaduct).

The 1.0 format (a project with no `.FABulous` directory, read from
`npnroutput/`) is no longer supported and nextpnr exits with an error. Either
regenerate the fabric with a current FABulous, or stay on nextpnr 0.11.1.

All of these files are produced together by the `gen_pnr_model` CLI command.

## `bel.txt` (legacy, unused)

`bel.txt` is the primitive description file, in order of tiles. Each line is one
BEL: tile, X, Y, Z (a letter), primitive type, then its ports.

## `bel.v2.txt`

The 2.0 format describes each BEL as a block delimited by `BelBegin`/`BelEnd`
rather than a single line. This makes the port-to-wire mapping explicit and lets
the description carry extra information that a flat line cannot. Each line in a
block is a command:

| Command                                  | Meaning                                                        |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `BelBegin,<tile>,<z>,<type>,<prefix>`    | Start a BEL at tile `<tile>`, Z position `<z>` (a letter)      |
| `I,<port>,<tile>.<wire>`                 | Input pin `<port>` driven by wire `<tile>.<wire>`              |
| `O,<port>,<tile>.<wire>`                 | Output pin `<port>` driving wire `<tile>.<wire>`               |
| `CFG,<feature>`                          | A configuration bit / feature of the BEL                       |
| `GlobalClk`                              | Connect the BEL to the fabric's global clock network           |
| `BelEnd`                                 | End the current BEL                                            |

A `FABULOUS_LC` block looks like:

```{code-block} text
    BelBegin,X1Y1,A,FABULOUS_LC,LA_
    I,I0,X1Y1.LA_I0
    I,I1,X1Y1.LA_I1
    I,I2,X1Y1.LA_I2
    I,I3,X1Y1.LA_I3
    I,Ci,X1Y1.LA_Ci
    I,SR,X1Y1.LA_SR
    I,EN,X1Y1.LA_EN
    O,O,X1Y1.LA_O
    O,Co,X1Y1.LA_Co
    CFG,FF
    CFG,INIT
    CFG,INIT[1]
    CFG,INIT[2]
    ...
    CFG,INIT[15]
    CFG,I0mux
    CFG,SET_NORESET
    CFG,INIT
    CFG,IOmux
    GlobalClk
    BelEnd
```

In nextpnr, the BELs in a tile are usually identified by their Z-axis (A/B/C/D),
like following `X1Y1.A` for the `FABULOUS_LC` in the example above.
Except the BRAM IO BELs `InPass4_frame_config` / `OutPass4_frame_config` and their
`_mux` variants - they are typically named by they `prefix` name, so they have readable name.

(belv3txt-bel-timing)=

## `bel.v3.txt` (BEL timing)

`bel.v3.txt` is identical to `bel.v2.txt` with additional **timing-arc** lines
inside each BEL block. Each arc maps directly to one of nextpnr's
`addCellTiming*` calls, so the file lets the fabric describe its own BEL timing
instead of relying on constants compiled into nextpnr.

| Line                                                | nextpnr call               | Meaning                              |
| --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `Delay,<from>,<to>,<ns>[,<cond>]`                   | `addCellTimingDelay`       | Combinational delay `<from>` -> `<to>`|
| `SetupHold,<port>,<clk>,<setup>,<hold>[,<cond>]`    | `addCellTimingSetupHold`   | Register input setup/hold to `<clk>` |
| `ClkToOut,<port>,<clk>,<ns>[,<cond>]`               | `addCellTimingClockToOut`  | Register output clock-to-out         |
| `Clock,<clk>[,<cond>]`                              | `addCellTimingClock`       | Declare `<clk>` as a clock pin       |

All delays are in nanoseconds.

### Clock arrival time

`GlobalClk,<ns>` attaches the BEL to the fabric's clock network and gives the
time the clock edge reaches *this* flop:

```{code-block} text
GlobalClk,1.37
```

nextpnr applies it to the pseudo-pip feeding the BEL's `CLK` pin, so it lands in
the routed clock delay the timing analyser uses for launch and capture. The
delay field is `bel.v3.txt` only: `bel.v2.txt` writes a bare `GlobalClk`, for
which nextpnr uses its built-in default of `1.0`.

:::{important}
Only *differences* between flops produce clock skew. A uniform value, which is
what FABulous writes by default if no timing model is generated,
is common mode: it is added to both the launch and
the capture side of every register-to-register path and cancels exactly, leaving
skew at zero.
:::

### Conditions

The optional trailing `<cond>` field gates an arc on how the design actually
uses the BEL. It is an `&`-joined list of predicates that nextpnr evaluates per
cell during placement; if the field is absent the arc always applies. The
predicates are:

- `PARAM=1` / `PARAM=0` - the cell's configuration bit / parameter `PARAM` is
  set / unset (e.g. `FF=1` for a registered LUT).
- `PORT[/PORT...]?` - at least one of the listed ports is connected; the
  `/`-list is an OR (e.g. `Ci/Co?` matches a LUT used in a carry chain).
- `PORT[/PORT...]!` - none of the listed ports are connected.

Because the conditions are evaluated against each placed cell, the same physical
BEL contributes different arcs depending on its mode. For example a LUT used
combinationally gets an input-to-output `Delay`, while the same LUT used as a
flip-flop instead gets `SetupHold` on its inputs and `ClkToOut` on `Q`.

A `FABULOUS_LC` block with timing:

    ClkToOut,Q,CLK,1.0,FF=1
    GlobalClk,1.0
    BelEnd
```

`Q` looks like a pseudo-port (nextpnr synthesises a `Q` pseudo-pin for
routing after loading the BEL file), but for *timing* it's a real
cell port: FABulous's packer renames the cell's `O` output to `Q`
whenever the FF is used. This is a special case for the
FABULOUS_LC, for every other BEL, there should be no pseudo pins.

:::{warning}
The BEL timing values FABulous writes
are **fixed placeholder constants**, equal to
the values nextpnr historically hard-coded; they are **not** yet derived from
a characterised timing model.
Only pip delays (`pips.txt`) are produced by the timing model today, see
[Timing Characterization](../../building_doc/timing_characterization.md).
:::

## `pips.txt`

`pips.txt` is the routing-resource description: one programmable interconnect
point per line, with its delay.

The delay column is an arbitrary placeholder (`8`) unless a timing model is run,
in which case it is replaced by a characterised per-pip delay; see
[Timing Characterization](../../building_doc/timing_characterization.md) for how
those delays are generated.

The column is unitless: nextpnr multiplies it by `pipDelayScale` from
[`placement_estimate.txt`](#placement-estimate) (default `0.05`) to get
nanoseconds, so the placeholder `8` is `0.4` ns.

(placement-estimate)=

## `placement_estimate.txt`

`placement_estimate.txt` is a `key=value` file of nextpnr placement/routing
tunables. FABulous writes nextpnr's historical defaults, so each value is also
what nextpnr falls back to when the key or the whole file is absent:

```{code-block} text
delayScale=3.0
delayOffset=3.0
delayEpsilon=0.25
ripupPenalty=0.5
carryPredictDelay=0.5
pipDelayScale=0.05
```

| Key                 | nextpnr target             | Default | Meaning                                                    |
| ------------------- | -------------------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `delayScale`        | `setDelayScaling` scale    | 3.0     | `predictDelay` cost per tile of distance                   |
| `delayOffset`       | `setDelayScaling` offset   | 3.0     | Fixed `predictDelay` baseline (pip/pin setup overhead)     |
| `carryPredictDelay` | `predictDelay` `Co`->`Ci`   | 0.5     | Carry-chain placement estimate (dedicated interconnect)    |
| `delayEpsilon`      | `ctx->delay_epsilon`       | 0.25    | Smallest delay difference the timing analysis resolves     |
| `ripupPenalty`      | `ctx->ripup_penalty`       | 0.5     | Router cost for ripping up an existing route               |
| `pipDelayScale`     | `pips.txt` delay column    | 0.05    | Nanoseconds per unit of the `pips.txt` integer delay       |

nextpnr's placer decides where every BEL goes *before* anything is routed, so
it can't yet know a connection's real pip delay (`pips.txt`), only the two
BEL locations. nextpnrs `predictDelay` function fills that gap with a cheap
Manhattan-distance estimate used to compare candidate placements:

```{code-block} text
estimated_delay = (|dx| + |dy|) * delayScale + delayOffset
```

`delayScale` is the marginal cost per tile of distance; `delayOffset` is a
fixed baseline added regardless of distance (e.g. pip/pin setup overhead).
This estimate only ever steers *which placement is picked*;
the real numbers in the final timing report always come from the
actual routed pips and `bel.v3.txt`'s arcs, never from `predictDelay`.

`carryPredictDelay` is the analogous estimate for the `FABULOUS_LC` carry
chain (`Co`->`Ci`).
It is a flat `0.5` (nextpnr's original hardcoded value),
independent of `delayScale`. `delayEpsilon` and `ripupPenalty`
are plain nextpnr placer/router knobs FABulous simply echoes at their defaults.

`pipDelayScale` is the exception: it is not an estimate but the unit of the
`pips.txt` delay column, which is a plain integer. nextpnr multiplies it by
`pipDelayScale` to get nanoseconds, so this key *does* move the numbers in the
final routed timing report. The default `0.05` reproduces nextpnr's historical
hardcoded factor, matching the placeholder delay column (`8` -> `0.4` ns). A
timing model that characterises pips directly in nanoseconds should write
`pipDelayScale=1.0`; see
[Timing Characterization](../../building_doc/timing_characterization.md).

:::{warning}
`pipDelayScale` must stay consistent with `delayScale`/`delayOffset`. The
placer's `predictDelay` estimate and the router's cost model are compared
against real pip delays, so raising `pipDelayScale` alone (e.g. to `1.0` while
leaving `delayScale=3.0`) makes every routed pip look far more expensive than
the estimate predicted and routing can fail outright. Rescale the estimate keys
by the same factor.
:::

:::{note}
Apart from `pipDelayScale`, none of these keys scale `bel.v3.txt`'s
BEL-internal arcs (LUT/FF/carry timing) or the routed report, they only steer
placement and routing.
Any key (or the whole file, for legacy or
unregenerated projects) that is missing falls back to the default in the table,
matching nextpnr's original hard-coded values. By default, FABulous writes
`delayOffset` equal to `delayScale`.
:::

### Per-type placement estimates

After the scaling keys, FABulous appends one representative block per timed
BEL type, delimited by `BelBegin,<type>`/`BelEnd` and containing the same
timing-arc lines as `bel.v3.txt` (minus the pin lines): `FABULOUS_LC`, the
registered output pads (`OutPass4_frame_config`, `OutPass4_frame_config_mux`,
`SetupHold` arcs on `I0`-`I3`), and the registered input pads
(`InPass4_frame_config`, `InPass4_frame_config_mux`, `ClkToOut` arcs on
`O0`-`O3`):

```{code-block} text
delayScale=3.0
delayOffset=3.0
...
BelBegin,FABULOUS_LC
Clock,CLK,FF=1
Delay,I0,O,3.0,FF=0
...
SetupHold,I0,CLK,2.5,0.1,FF=1
ClkToOut,Q,CLK,1.0,FF=1
BelEnd
BelBegin,OutPass4_frame_config
SetupHold,I0,CLK,2.5,0.1
...
BelEnd
BelBegin,InPass4_frame_config
ClkToOut,O0,CLK,2.5
...
BelEnd
```

nextpnr applies BEL timing in two passes: these representative blocks steer
placement (every instance of a type is estimated with its type's block), then
after placement each BEL's own `bel.v3.txt` arcs replace them, so the routed
report is per-instance.

:::{note}
`bel.v3.txt` and `placement_estimate.txt` are written
together; if only one is present nextpnr warns (regenerate with
`gen_pnr_model`).

Like `delayScale`/`delayOffset`, this block only steers
placement, the final report always uses `bel.v3.txt`'s arcs.
