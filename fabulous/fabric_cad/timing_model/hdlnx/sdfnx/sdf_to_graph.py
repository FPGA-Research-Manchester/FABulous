"""SDF to Timing Graph Conversion Module.

This module provides functionality to convert SDF files into timing graphs represented
as NetworkX directed graphs. It is the main class used to create timing graphs from SDF
files. It is derived from SDFTimingGraphBase which provides basic functionality.

New algorithms can be added here. Note that this is a low level module focused on graph
algorithms based on the SDF, and should not contain high-level algorithms based on
verilog netlists.

        Parameters
        ----------
        source : str
            The source node.
        target : str

            The target node.

        Returns
        -------
        bool

        The function first finds all nodes reachable from every source.
        It then restricts to the structurally earliest common region(s), using SCCs
        of the common-reachable subgraph. Among those candidates it minimizes:

            cost(v) = max_i dist(s_i, v)      if mode == "max"
            cost(v) = sum_i dist(s_i, v)      if mode == "sum"

        If several candidates still tie, it prefers the one that can
        still reach the largest downstream common region. If there is still a tie,
        it prefers the one that can reach more total downstream nodes. Final fallback
        is lexicographic node order.

        For a single source, the earliest common node is normally the source itself.
        If `prefer_sentinel_for_single_source` is True and the source can reach the
        sentinel, we follow the shortest path to the sentinel and return the node
        we walk follow_steps_to_sentinel edges along that path.

        Parameters
        ----------

        mode : str
            "max" to minimize worst distance, "sum" to minimize total distance.
        sentinel : str | None
            Optional node that can be returned if only one source is given.
        prefer_sentinel_for_single_source : bool
            If True and exactly one source is given, return the sentinel instead of the

        follow_steps_to_sentinel : int
