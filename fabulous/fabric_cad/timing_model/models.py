"""Models for the SDF timing model generation and analysis.

This module defines the data models used for representing the SDF timing graph,
components, and configuration for the timing model generation process. It includes
enumerations for cell types, delay types, timing model modes, synthesis and STA tools,
as well as dataclasses and Pydantic models for components, the SDF graph object, and the
timing model configuration. These models provide a structured way to represent the
timing information extracted from SDF files and the configuration parameters for
generating timing models, allowing for easier manipulation and analysis of the timing
data throughout the processing pipeline.
