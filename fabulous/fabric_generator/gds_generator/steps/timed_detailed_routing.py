"""Detailed Routing step with a hard wall-clock timeout.

During tile-size exploration TritonRoute can spin for hours on pathological
dies. This step wraps :class:`librelane.steps.openroad.DetailedRouting` so that
if routing has not finished within `FABULOUS_DRT_TIMEOUT` seconds the entire
OpenROAD process group is killed and a :class:`DRTTimedOutError` is raised,
which the surrounding optimisation loop treats as a hard stop.
